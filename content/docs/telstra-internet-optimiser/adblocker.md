Adblocker will block Ads, Tracking and Malware on all devices on your network. You can select which devices are filtered and which are not. You can also customize the blacklists to block specific websites.

By default, Adblocker will block most online advertising and telemetry domains with no extra steps needed.

## Adblock Bubble Chart

A) Click Enable Adblocker to get started. Blocked adverts will appear as bubbles in real-time. Click a bubble to see the domains within.

B) Click Pause to temporarily disable Adblocker per device, or disable Adblocker on a device entirely.

## Creating Lists

A) If the website you want to access is blocked, add the website domain to a Whitelist.

B) Find more advert lists online and add their URL to a Blacklist to improve blocking, or manually add your own domains to block.
