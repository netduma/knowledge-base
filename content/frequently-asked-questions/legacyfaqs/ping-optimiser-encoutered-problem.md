## Why am I seeing this?

You may see this message appear if Ping Optimiser is unable to complete it's test.Â This could be for a couple of reasons:

- You have temporarily lost your WAN connection
- The external server used by the test did not respond

## How can I fix this?

Don't worry, this is rarely ever a serious issue and can be easily resolved by restarting the test.

If after this you are still encountering this problem, please try rebooting your gateway.
