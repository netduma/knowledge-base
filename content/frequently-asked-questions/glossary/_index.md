## Fast Search

Fast Search is an add-on to Ping Assist. Enabling Fast Search makes Ping Assist work much faster, which should make finding games quicker. However, this may occasionally mean you allow a connection that is above your Ping Assist limit. If you would prefer to avoid this, disable Fast Search. This may result in longer search times.

## Strict Mode

Strict Mode guarantees that dedicated servers outside of your filter range will always be blocked. This should be ticked when searching in most games. Previously, it was necessary to have this disabled in Destiny, but since Bungieâ€™s upgrade to server-based matchmaking you can now leave this enabled.

## Share Excess

Share Excess automatically allocates any unused bandwidth to a device that needs it. Unchecking Share Excess caps the percentage allocated to each device, preventing unneeded bandwidth from being shared across your network. We recommend you keep this option checked.
