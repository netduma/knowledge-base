title: What is Strict Mode?
---

Strict Mode guarantees that dedicated servers outside of 
your filter range will always be blocked. This should be ticked when 
searching in most games. Previously, it was necessary to have this 
disabled in Destiny, but since Bungie’s upgrade to server-based 
matchmaking you can now leave this enabled.
