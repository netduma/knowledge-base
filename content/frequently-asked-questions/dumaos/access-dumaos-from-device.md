Yes, the interface is browser based so it will work on any device with a browser.Â You can also download the DumaOS Mobile App from the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netdumasoftware.dumamobile&hl=en-US)/[App Store](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/dumaos/id1532022492).
