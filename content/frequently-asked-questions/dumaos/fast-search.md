title: What is Fast Search?
weight: 9
---

Fast Search is an 
add-on to Ping Assist. Enabling Fast Search makes Ping Assist work much 
faster, which should make finding games quicker. However, this may 
occasionally mean you allow a connection that is above your Ping Assist 
limit. If you would prefer to avoid this, disable Fast Search. This may 
result in longer search times.
