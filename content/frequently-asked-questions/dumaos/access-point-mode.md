title: Can you use DumaOS in Access Point mode?
weight: 7

The __NETGEAR Nighthawk Pro Gaming__ routers will allow you to go into access point mode. However the vast majority of DumaOS features will not function in this mode. It would be a much better idea to put the Netduma router into the DMZ of the router above it.

__No other DumaOS hardware will allow you to use Access Point mode.__
