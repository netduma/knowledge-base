title: DumaOS 3 - Is my VPN compatible with Hybrid-VPN?
---

Hybrid VPN has presets for purevpn and hidemyass, but it will actually work with any VPN service that will provide an OpenVPN file! Simply download an OpenVPN file from your VPN of choice, press ADD VPN in DumaOS, and paste the OpenVPN file into the advanced tab!
