For gaming, Netduma recommends using ethernet instead of WiFi wherever possible. Our advanced QoS features will help your online gaming to run smoothly even when other people in your house are using the internet.

For those situations where WiFi is the only connection type available, we support WiFi QoS technologies which will tag Gaming and Work from Home traffic as a top priority.
