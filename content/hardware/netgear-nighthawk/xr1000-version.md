linkTitle: XR1000 Version
---

There are two versions of the XR1000 on the market. They are identical in terms of functionality, but some of the internal components were changed. Because of this, they require separate firmware files.

Log onto DumaOS in your browser by visiting routerlogin.net while connected to your home network. The version number at the top right of the screen will either say "xr1000" or "xr1000v2". Make a note of this.
